## Info 

Oxymora Client is a Hack client made for [anarchy servers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Front_Page) (like 2b2t),
and for [CrystalPVP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystal_PvP) Servers like [crystalpvp.cc](https://crystalpvp.cc). It first started its
development in 2022 and it is the idea, to make a very strong client in two variants. The first variant is mainly
focused to be for anarchy and the second for crystalpvp and many bypasses for crystalpvp.cc. I will mainly focus on
this server, because its the best cpvp server. I'll update this client often, so modules like Burrow (glitching in a 
block so the opponent makes less damage) and PacketFly (selfexplaining lol) as these two are getting constantly patched.
I'll update the CrystalAura too to hold it on the best and fastest possible. So, this Client comes with a launcher. 
In this launcher you can select the version that you want and which client part. I'll probably do a merged version but that later.
There will be a paid version too in development with exploits, more bypasses and many nice addons. So stay tuned!
With that being said, enjoy this Client! ðŸ™‚
