  <p>Oxymora Client is a hack client made for anarchy servers (like 2b2t), and for CrystalPVP servers like crystalpvp.cc.<br>It first started its development in 2022 and it is the idea, to make a very strong client in two variants.<br>The first variant is mainly focused to be for anarchy and the second for crystalpvp and many bypasses for crystalpvp.cc.<br>I will mainly focus on this server, because it's the best cpvp server.<br>I'll update this client often, so modules like Burrow (glitching in a block so the opponent makes less damage) and PacketFly (selfexplaining) as these two are getting constantly patched.<br>I'll update the CrystalAura too to hold it on the best and fastest possible.<br>So, this client comes with a launcher.<br>In this launcher you can select the version that you want and which client part.<br>I'll probably do a merged version but that later.<br>There will be a paid version too in development with exploits, more bypasses and many nice addons.<br>So stay tuned! With that being said, enjoy this Client!</p>
